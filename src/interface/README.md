# pyqt-paint
pyqt painting widget

PyQtPaint is a PyQt4 widget that features a canvas and layering
system that can ultimately be used to create artist-oriented interfaces
for tools and applications. PyQtPaint gives artists a familiar interface
that allows them to input custom painted images without having to open
an independent software package.

It was created by [Daniel Pebly](http://danielpebly.com/) at the Savannah College Art and Design (SCAD)
as a part of his senior studio-based project.

The tool consists of several subclassed widgets that communicate with
one another.

The widget is imported from pyqtpaint.
An example of the tool can be found by running the example.py script.
